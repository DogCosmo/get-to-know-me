# get-to-know-me
Get to Know Me is a website that tells you all about me (Aanya)! It includes an about section where I listed some information about me and a favorites section where I list some of my favorite things. It also includes a progrmaming languages section that tells you the different languages I can code in. I made this website to help people know me a bit better, and give them an idea of who I am! To navigate to the different sections, either scroll through the website normally or you can click on the buttons at the top. Some fun things I included in my website is falling hearts in the background and a sparkles cursor! I struggled a little with making those features but it all worked out in the end!1 Try out the cursor for yourself, just drag your mouse around and you'll notice that there are little sparkles moving with your mouse. The website has a futuristic New York City theme to it as well! I hope this website was helpful and got you guys to know me better!
